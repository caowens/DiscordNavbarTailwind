# DiscordNavbarTailwind

This is a clone of the discord navbar using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This was done by following the [Ultimate Tailwind CSS Tutorial // Build a Discord-inspired Animated Navbar](https://youtu.be/pfaSUYaSgRo?si=egWyrLn1k0uCc7za) by Fireship on Youtube. This was an attempt to learn Tailwind CSS by use of a project that uses many of it's capabilities.
